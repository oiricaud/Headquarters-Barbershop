# Headquarters-Barbershop
💈A react website using Material UI to build a sleek site for my mothers barbershop. 💈 💇

This is my first React Application. If you are trying to clone this, merely unzip the folder and go to the terminal. 

    unzip file

    cd unzippedFileDirectory

    cd barbershop/src

    npm start
    

If you encounter command not found, you most likely need to install npm. 

just 

    npm install
